		<div class="about">
<p>Hello, my name is Hitesh Sabnani. I am a Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast. This website hosts my projects and my blog. I graduated with MS degrees in Computer Science and Applied Economics from UCSD and University of North Dakota respectively. Prior to that, I finished my undergraduate degree in Information and Communication Technology from DA-IICT, India. In my free time, I like to play strategy board-games, watch sports and suspense / thriller TV shows and movies. I also like to read non-fiction, primarily behavioral economics and investment / personal finance.</p>
