**Exploring bias-variance trade-off for classification and regression**  
This project used Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbor Regression, and Decision Trees on Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices and Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbor Classification, Naive Bayes, and SVM to predict Titanic survivors. The focus is on understanding bias-variance trade-off and underfitting / overfitting using learning and validation curves.

**IMDB TV Show Analysis**   
This project looked at various questions for IMDB TV Show dataset - like if certain TV shows are overrated / underrated, their consistency, did the TV series cancel early or was too long, analysis of variables over time - like genres, new series; evidence for ageism and rating discrimination over gender of lead actor.
